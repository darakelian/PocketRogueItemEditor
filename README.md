# PocketRogueItemEditor
I made this item editor in order to efficiently create JSON item definition files for my game.
Features of the item editor include:  
-Prompts user to select JSON file for editing if one hasn't been selected.  
-Allows user to configure spritesheet item coordinates from image files.  
-Leverages DataGridView for displaying the definitions.  
-Easily expandable to add new item properties.  

TODOS:  
-Add custom item properties from within the editor without hard coding them.  
-Export to other formats besides JSON.
